# Project Description:

This project sets out to understand if video games are “recession proof.” Our intended user persona is an independent investor or a firm analyst looking to better understand the gaming industry. Ultimately, our project will help our user determine if video games are part of a recession investment strategy. We analyzed video game sales data across Japan, North America, and Europe to see sales trends and learn about the biggest publishers. We then focus on sales for Japan and the United States (using North America as a proxy as ~92% of “NA” sales come from the U.S.) against basic economic indicators for each country (GDP growth rates and unemployment rates). Finally, we focus on a key set of video game publishers listed on American exchanges (Take Two, Activision, Electronic Arts, and Ubisoft) and track their market performances against the Nasdaq Composite Index.
